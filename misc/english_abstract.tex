	Survival analysis, aiming at predicting the probability that individuals experience the interested event during the observation, utilizes survival predictive model to find the relation between predictors and the outcome of interested event, or explore the important impact factor and the pattern of interested event occurrence. It is an important tool for risk estimation in healthcare, finance, and other fields. Particularly in clinical disease research, survival analysis methods are essential in many scenarios.
	
	The traditional survival analysis methods, such as the Cox proportional hazard model and the first hitting time model, solved the problem of using the model to predict individual survival probability. This sort of traditional survival analysis method is simple, intuitive and interpretable. However, the prior assumption and linear function of them restrict the prediction accuracy to some extend. To solve the problem, researchers proposed survival analysis methods that exploited tree model or others as its base learner to enhance the model performance. Although it weakened the prior assumption and overcame the requirement of variables independence, the model performance was limited as it did not abandon the assumptions totally. When the distribution of survival data is unknown or a priori knowledge is lacking, these assumptions will limit the prediction accuracy of the model. Moreover, the deep learning based survival predictive models were also proposed. Although these models have strong representation ability, they sacrifice the model interpretability and then restrict their applications in the real world.

    When the survival data satisfies the hypothesis of proportional hazard or a priori knowledge is sufficient, many algorithms of the Cox genre which are based on the Cox proportional hazard model have a wide range of application scenarios. Among them, the Cox genre algorithms built with the tree model as its base learner, take the advantage of  non-linear models to enhance the model representation ability. They often take the partial likelihood function as the objective function and use the gradient boosting algorithm to optimize the model structure. However, if there are many event occurrences in the survival data, the model will suffer from parameters estimation bias and a decreased accuracy as the partial likelihood function is not enough precise. At the same time, these traditional decision tree models are prone to overfitting due to the lack of regularization terms.

    In order to solve these problems, based on the gradient boosting decision tree, this thesis proposed two novel survival analysis methods named HitBoost and BecCox. The HitBoost method utilizes multi output gradient boosting decision tree to directly predict the density function of the first hitting time. In addition to using the likelihood function as the objective function, the concordance index approximated by a convex function is also added as a part of it. The HitBoost method is no longer based on any prior assumptions and still has a certain model interpretability. And the BecCox method, which mainly optimizes the Cox genre algorithms, utilizes the single gradient boosting decision tree to predict the proportional hazard of the interested event occurrence. In the objective function of BecCox, we exploit a more precise partial likelihood function, combined with a concordance index approximated by a convex function, which indeed narrows the prediction bias brought by the objective function.

	The thesis first deduced the gradients of the custom objective function with respect to the predicted value, and then implemented the HitBoost and BecCox methods under XGBoost framework according to the different types of model output. The experimental results on four benchmarks show that the HitBoost method is more accurate in predicting the individual survival function than methods that follow the prior assumption and the commonly used Random Survival Forest; the BecCox method has better risk prediction performance than the classic Cox proportional hazard model, and the other algorithms of Cox genre. Finally, we used the clinical data of breast cancer patients from the Breast Cancer Research Center of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. And the proposed HitBoost method was utilized to build a recurrence prognosis model for the early stage breast cancer patients. At the same time, taking the advantages of the HitBoost method, this thesis also showed the applications of the breast cancer recurrence prognosis model, such as exploring important factors that affect breast cancer recurrence and making treatment recommendations. Therefore, the gradient boosting decision tree based optimization methods proposed in this thesis can be utilized as an effective survival analysis method for the research and application of clinical diseases or other specific interested events.
